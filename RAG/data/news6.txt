Oslo, Norway — Environmental organizations and governments from over 50 countries have launched a global initiative called “Plastic-Free Oceans” aimed at reducing plastic waste in marine environments. The program promotes improved recycling infrastructure, bans on single-use plastics, and innovation in biodegradable materials.

The initiative also funds clean-up projects and raises awareness about the impact of plastic pollution on wildlife and human health.

Marine biologist Dr. Luis Hernandez stated, “Protecting our oceans is vital for biodiversity and the health of the planet.”
