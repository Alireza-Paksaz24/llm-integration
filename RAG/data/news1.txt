1. Breakthrough in Climate Change Mitigation Announced at UN Summit

Geneva, Switzerland — At the annual United Nations Climate Change Summit held this week, scientists and world leaders unveiled a groundbreaking plan aimed at reducing global carbon emissions by 50% over the next decade. The initiative, dubbed “Green Horizon,” calls for a coordinated effort to transition to renewable energy sources, enhance energy efficiency, and promote sustainable urban development.

The plan emphasizes the deployment of solar and wind infrastructure, reforestation programs, and carbon capture technologies. The summit also featured commitments from over 70 countries to phase out coal power plants and invest in green technology.

UN Secretary-General António Guterres remarked, “This is a critical moment for humanity. Our survival depends on decisive actions to combat climate change.”
